# FIT3097_A1

## Assignment Specifications
This scene was developed in Unreal Engine 5.

I used a variety of methods taught in FIT3097 (Technical Art) from Monash University, mostly pertaining to shaderwork and material design.

The assets used in the scene design are grabbed from Quixel Bridge (now known as Fab).
